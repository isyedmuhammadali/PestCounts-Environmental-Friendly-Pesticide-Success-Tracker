# PestCounts-Environmental-Friendly-Pesticide-Success-Tracker

This project is my second-semester endeavor, designed to manage tests conducted in various fields to assess the performance of pesticides.

The program begins by prompting the user to specify the number of fields and the number of tests for each field. Users can then enter test scores for each field, facilitating a structured approach to data collection.

Following the data input, a menu-based user interface appears, offering various data modification functionalities and result display options. This allows users to view, modify, and analyze test results effectively.

The implementation relies on C++ concepts, including pointers, functions, dynamic memory allocation, and dynamic arrays, ensuring efficient memory management and flexibility in handling varying amounts of data.
